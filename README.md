# GraphVisualizator (VERY ALPHA VERSION)

To build project:
```
git clone https://github.com/youngcapy/GraphVisualizator

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
**Final .exe is in build/debug**

Right now you can visualize these ones:
1. Bubble sort
2. Quick sort
3. Selection sort
4. Bogo sort :D

**BUT....**

You can`t in this version enter your own array... It is incoming.
